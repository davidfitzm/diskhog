# diskhog
A Python program to display the size of a directory tree.
Can we build a better version of disk-hog?

First it needs to be totally clean from the lint and pystyle point of view.
It also needs a Tkinter GUI.
It needs to be more Object oriented, and the HTML objects need to be the same as in Page Builder.
It needs a GitHup Project of its own.
It needs a document that will be the basis of the blog post.
